## Summary of Issues:

### ✅ Issues Fixed:

1. **Level 10 (Average):** 
   - ✅ **FIXED:** Changed from "Arrays.sort()" to manual sorting (bubble sort or selection sort)
   - Now uses loops and conditionals for sorting, which is within scope

### ✅ Overall Assessment:

- **20 out of 20 levels** are fully aligned with story mode topics
- **All levels** properly use only core programming topics
- **No advanced Java features** found in objectives.js files (Scanner, Random, ArrayList, etc.)
- **Manual sorting algorithms** are used (bubble sort, selection sort) which is good
- **All objectives.js files** verified to be within scope

---

## Final Status:

✅ **ALL LEVELS ALIGNED** - All 20 levels now properly align with story mode topics
✅ **No out-of-scope features** - All levels use only core programming topics
✅ **Manual sorting used** - Sorting algorithms are implemented manually (bubble sort, selection sort)
