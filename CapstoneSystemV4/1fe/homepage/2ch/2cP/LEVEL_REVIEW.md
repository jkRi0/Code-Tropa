### ✅ Overall Assessment:

- **20 out of 20 levels** are fully aligned with story mode topics
- **All levels** properly use only core programming topics
- **No advanced C++ features** found in objectives.js files (std::sort, rand, algorithm library, etc.)
- **Manual sorting algorithms** are used (bubble sort, selection sort) which is good
- **std::cin and std::cout** are acceptable as basic input/output (part of basic syntax)
- **iomanip** is acceptable for basic output formatting

---

## Final Status:

✅ **ALL LEVELS ALIGNED** - All 20 levels now properly align with story mode topics
✅ **No out-of-scope features** - All levels use only core programming topics
✅ **Manual sorting used** - Sorting algorithms are implemented manually (bubble sort, selection sort)
